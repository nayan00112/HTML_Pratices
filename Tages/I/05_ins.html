    <!-- HTML <ins> tag is used to represent the newly added text in an HTML document. It usually renders with an underline through the text, but it can be changed using CSS property.

        The <ins> tag is more useful when it is used with the <del> element as it represents the part of the text that has been deleted and <ins> represent the part of the text that has been inserted to the document. -->
