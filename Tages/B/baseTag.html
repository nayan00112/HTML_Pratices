<!-- 
HTML <base> tag is used to specify a base URI or URL to use for all relative links contained within an HTML document.

Only one <base> element can be specified within a document, and it must be placed within <head> element. We can also specify how other links should open (in the same window, in another window, etc.) using the target attribute. -->
