            HTML dir tag was used as a container for the list of files/folders or content of the directory. The dir
            element is used with the li tags, and list of directories renders in bullets by default.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note: Do not use HTML dir tag as it is deprecated now and not supported in HTML5. You can use ul
            tag and CSS property instead.
