<!-- HTML <frameset> tag (Not supported in HTML5)
HTML <frameset> tag is used to contain the group of frames which can be controlled and styled as a unit. The <frameset> element also specifies the number of rows and columns in the frameset, and how much space they will occupy in a frame.

Note: Do not use HTML <frameset> element as it is deprecated and not supported by HTML5, but you can use <iframe> tag instead. -->

<frameset cols="30%,50%,20%"> 
    <frame src="01_fildset.html">
        <frame src="02_figure_and_figcaption_tags.html">
            <frame src="03_font.html">
</frameset>

<!-- HTML <frame> tag define the particular area within an HTML file where another HTML web page can be displayed.

A <frame> tag is used with <frameset>, and it divides a webpage into multiple sections or frames, and each frame can contain different web pages.

Note: Do not use HTML <frame> tag as it is not supported in HTML5, instead you can use <iframe> or <div> with CSS to achieve similar effects in HTML. -->
