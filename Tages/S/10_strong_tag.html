        HTML Strong tag 
    </h1>
    <p>
        HTML strong tag is a phrase tag which used to represent the important text of a document on the browser.
        The text within strong text has semantic importance for the search engines and emphasize the text with spcial intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The text within strong tag renders in bold font on the browser by default; however it can be changed using CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: Do not use strong tag just for making text bold, and if you want to make your text bold without any semantic importance then 
        use bold tag 'b' or CSS property.
    </p>
