        <h1>HTML Div Tag:</h1>
        <p>The HTML div tag is used to group the larg section of html elements together.</p>
        <p>We know that every tag has a specific purpose e.g. p tag is used to specify pragraph, h1 to h6 tag are used to specify heading but the div tag is just like a container unit which is used to encapsulate other page element and divides the HTML document into sections.</p>
